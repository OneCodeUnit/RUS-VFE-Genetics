  <!-- Boomalope - Bear -->

  <GR_Boomabear.label>boomabear</GR_Boomabear.label>
  <GR_Boomabear.description>Originally intended as a way to make boomalopes more combat viable, their powerful muscles have instead been focused on compressing its produced chemfuel as a way to store greater amounts of chemfuel without care of how dangerous it is.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive ursine genes. Consumes more than twice as much compared to a boomalope but produces deepchem instead. They’re also capable of defending themselves should any predator be foolish enough to go after them.</GR_Boomabear.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Chicken -->

  <GR_Boomachicken.label>boomachicken</GR_Boomachicken.label>
  <GR_Boomachicken.description>A biological weapon in compact form, these living, breathing, shitting bombs are ideally assembled into a massive horde and sent squawking at the enemy. Allegedly, this particular hybrid has been brought up in certain court cases as the original creator thought it would be funny to create “lethal egg timers”.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive avian genes. Produces edible eggs very slowly, but can lay a clutch of explosive eggs twice a day. They’re both reasonably intelligent and quick on their feet.</GR_Boomachicken.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Muffalo -->

  <GR_Boomffalo.label>boomffalo</GR_Boomffalo.label>
  <GR_Boomffalo.description>People love efficiency and having one thing to cover all their needs. Well this isn’t it, but it gets damn close. The chemfuel sacs have mixed with milk-producing glands, which make for a milk that smells like pure gasoline and could almost power a vehicle.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive muffalo genes. Has a large appetite due to it producing multiple products, namely deepchem, thin wool and an unusual milk that shares properties with Chemshine.</GR_Boomffalo.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Wolf -->

  <GR_Boomwolf.label>boomwolf</GR_Boomwolf.label>
  <GR_Boomwolf.description>For those who wished they could equip their canines with explosive vests, the Boomwolf stores pressurised - almost solidified - chemfuel which can be remotely discharged as a non-explosive gas. Thanks to thermodynamics, it is extremely cold upon release and can just as easily hurt the hybrid as well as everything nearby.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive canine genes. Very intelligent, fast and dangerous, they make for an interesting combat animal. One of the few canine-type hybrids that work better solo than as a pack.</GR_Boomwolf.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Rodent -->

  <GR_Boomsquirrel.label>boomsquirrel</GR_Boomsquirrel.label>
  <GR_Boomsquirrel.description>With adorable horns and long snoots, these squeaky lads are ideal in giving your enemy a stunning surprise. Their chemfuel mixture includes other gases that create a blinding and disorienting flashbang when remotely detonated. They’ll still make a regular boom if killed though.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive rodent genes. Quite fast and intelligent, these hybrids work as excellent swarm attackers. Their rapid reproduction cycle and stunning explosion make for an ideal companion to ranged masters.</GR_Boomsquirrel.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Cat -->

  <GR_Boomcat.label>boomcat</GR_Boomcat.label>
  <GR_Boomcat.description>Combining the frequent nuzzling of a cat and the deepchem production of a primary boomalope hybrid is surely in no way going to end badly. Better not to ignore them should they complain loudly about wanting dinner.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive feline genes. They make for an interesting companion for those who desire chemfuel production but also want to be able to cuddle said creatures. They can also be butchered to retrieve an internal gland filled with deepchem.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Like all cat hybrids, they have an improved melee dodge ability and a short nuzzle period.</GR_Boomcat.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Humanoid -->

  <GR_Booman.label>booman</GR_Booman.label>
  <GR_Booman.description>Outright refuses to let anyone else milk them for their chemfuel as they view it as a violation of their humanoid rights. They make for a good conversation partner even if their stance can be a little volatile.\n\nA boomalope hybrid with recessive humanoid genes. Instead of supplying a regular amount of chemfuel, this hybrid will syphon themselves to top up a limited number of machinery powered by chemfuel, such as generators and pod launchers.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. Boomen periodically refuel some machines powered by chemfuel in a 10 tile radius (chemfuel generators and pod launchers).</GR_Booman.description>
