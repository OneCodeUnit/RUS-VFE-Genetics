  <!-- Reptile - Bear -->

  <GR_Bearodile.label>bearodile</GR_Bearodile.label>
  <GR_Bearodile.description>The dinosaur nerds out there should love this hybrid. Got one hell of a nasty bite and even the claws will both knock you down and make you unable to get up. Often bred for hunting by the bored one percenters who want to eat massive drumsticks, caveman style.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive ursine genes. Highly intelligent and an exceptional frontline trooper, with a venomous, stunning attack, fast movement speed and high health pool.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Bearodile.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Boomalope -->

  <GR_Boomsnake.label>boomsnake</GR_Boomsnake.label>
  <GR_Boomsnake.description>What happens when you mix a spitting cobra, a rattlesnake and a creature designed to lactate refined fuel? This abomination, that’s what. Drive it into a corner and it’ll hurt itself to release deadly neurotoxins. Try and keep your distance and it’ll spit toxic blood right at you. Clearly someone was a sore loser in playing pretend games as a child, but had either the brains or the money to prove themselves right.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive boomalope genes. Decently intelligent with a nasty bite and even nastier ranged attack, both causing toxic buildup. Quite a high metabolism which supports its various combat abilities, best suited for home defence.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Boomsnake.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Chicken -->

  <GR_Chickenlizard.label>chickenlizard</GR_Chickenlizard.label>
  <GR_Chickenlizard.description>Chickens are basically an evolution of dinosaurs, so someone decided to turn them back. Unfortunately they didn’t exactly bother to check that they should still be avian rather than reptilian, so it resulted in this nasty little thing that reproduces at an insane rate and empties your fridge. But hey, they’ll spit on your enemies and their right to shit everywhere, especially where they eat.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive avian genes. This particular farm animal is smart enough that it doesn’t need a pen and breeds faster than other reptiles. A very large appetite for a creature so small, which supports its ability to spit out nasty toxins on their enemies and create messes on the floor. Very easy to train and has a good memory.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Chickenlizard.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Muffalo -->

  <GR_Muffalokomodo.label>muffalokomodo</GR_Muffalokomodo.label>
  <GR_Muffalokomodo.description>Milking snakes for venom in order to create medicine is an extremely dangerous career. While this particular beast of burden proved to be capable in other areas, it was mainly synthesised in order to provide a safer way of sourcing an anaesthetic coagulant to be used in emergencies. Or someone was trying to get high by milking a reptilian space cow, who really knows.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive muffalo genes. A strong pack animal with a massive appetite and a proportionate filth rate. Quite durable and will prove a fatal mistake for any animal that attempts to hunt them, as their fangs, horns and claws are all venomous. Can be milked every ten days for a vial of paralysing coagulant, best used for large animals that are suffering from multiple lacerations.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Muffalokomodo.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Insectoid -->

  <GR_Spidersnake.label>spidersnake</GR_Spidersnake.label>
  <GR_Spidersnake.description>Neutroamine is rather difficult to manufacture due to the sterile environment needed in creating a synthetic precursor chemical. So some insane madman decided to create a living creature that can synthesise its own neutroamine. Granted it’s not a lot, but have enough of these disturbingly powerful and quick cobras and no one will ever try to rob you, or live long enough to get away.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive insectoid genes. For an animal so small, it has an incredibly powerful bite and can spit venom. Sadly they can’t be trained but will happily hunt smaller prey that happen to wander into their territory or fight back against any foolish predators. Can be milked once every several days for a vial of neutroamine, so they function well as part of a large drug farm.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Spidersnake.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Wolf -->

  <GR_Wolfsnake.label>wolfsnake</GR_Wolfsnake.label>
  <GR_Wolfsnake.description>A great doggo that sheds snakeskin instead of fur, so don’t be too alarmed when scratching at an itchy spot makes skin flake off. It’ll shed itself, even when out hunting prey, so be prepared to occasionally go on a long trek to pick up the valuable skin.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive canine genes. Fast, intelligent and with a nasty venomous bite, these hybrids make for an excellent hunting hound. They lack any notion of fear so they may end up going after much larger, more dangerous prey and achieving a pyrrhic victory.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Wolfsnake.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Cat -->

  <GR_Snakecat.label>snakecat</GR_Snakecat.label>
  <GR_Snakecat.description>Possibly one of the weirdest and cutest snakes to be ever created. They have several tiny legs which are used to push its body along, while also having an invitingly soft fur. Quite a lot of people never stop freaking out from something sliding up the backs of their legs only to get softly headbutted by a purring python.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive feline genes. An unusually furry snake that enjoys nuzzling while also hunting for prey much weaker than itself. Incredibly intelligent and easy to train, they combine quick reflexes and an incredibly nasty bite and spitting attack.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks.</GR_Snakecat.description>

  <!-- Reptile - Humanoid -->

  <GR_Lizardman.label>lizardman</GR_Lizardman.label>
  <GR_Lizardman.description>It is doubtful that one would meet a crueller or more sadistic creature than this hybrid. It actively experiences joy when slaughtering tame animals and executing prisoners, the latter of which even provides a powerful boost which can be used before battle. Maybe it has something to do with taking pleasure in killing those that made it this way, but that’s a story for another time.\n\nA reptile hybrid with recessive humanoid genes. A very intelligent but combat-limited animal that performs surprisingly poorly against similar sized creatures. They will only passively engage creatures much smaller than itself and takes some twisted, psychotic pleasure in killing those who are completely helpless.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. All reptile hybrids have good temperature tolerance ranges and venomous attacks. Lizardmen will obey order to slaughter other colony animals, as well as execute prisoners of the colony.</GR_Lizardman.description>
