  <!-- Humanoid - Bear -->

  <GR_Manbear.label>manbear</GR_Manbear.label>
  <GR_Manbear.description>What it lacks in ferocity, it makes up for in tenacity and formidable cuteness. What person, sane or insane, could reject the diplomatic arguments presented by a waist-high teddy bear with a face just begging to be pinched. Not that you actually would, as those sharp teeth remind one that it very likely prefers to debate with its food before eating it.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive ursine genes. Absolutely terrible in combat potential despite its genetic material, but it is surprisingly adept at convincing prisoners to join the colony.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. Menbear are adept conversationalists and will help in recruiting prisoners.</GR_Manbear.description>

  <!-- Humanoid - Boomalope -->

  <GR_Manalope.label>manalope</GR_Manalope.label>
  <GR_Manalope.description>A floating, ticking time bomb that produces extremely reactive chemicals instead of chemfuel. Arguably more of a complex chemical distillery than an animal, it's a scientific miracle that it doesn’t explode every time it coughs. Surprisingly effective in combat in ways the enemy would really have preferred not knowing.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive boomalope genes. Thanks to its sac filled with buoyant chemicals, this hybrid never touches the ground and simply floats from location to location. Ignores terrain penalty costs and traps, while also being able to set down explosive traps of its own.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. Set trap ability: once every 3 days the manalope can set up an explosive IED. Hovers over terrain, ignoring terrain costs, and doesn't trigger ANY traps.</GR_Manalope.description>

  <!-- Humanoid - Chicken -->

  <GR_Manchicken.label>manchicken</GR_Manchicken.label>
  <GR_Manchicken.description>“You know how, like, chicken tastes, like, so good? So what if, like, we made a chicken that, y’know, when you killed it you could, I dunno, stuff it right in your mouth as fried chicken? Dude, this shit is the shit, where did you get this, man?” - Recording playback used in a hearing against a disgraced genetic scientist for misappropriating government funding.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive avian genes. A very valuable hybrid that convinces people that its greatest desire in life is to be eaten. When butchered, it leaves large amounts of completely healthy and nutritious meat that can be eaten as-is.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. Doesn't lay eggs, but can be butchered for large amounts of a very nutritive meat that doesn't have poisoning chance and takes 6 days to rot.</GR_Manchicken.description>

  <!-- Humanoid - Muffalo -->

  <GR_Manffalo.label>manffalo</GR_Manffalo.label>
  <GR_Manffalo.description>Considered a straight upgrade from their progenitor, featured several times in Cannibal Monthly. Produces appreciable amounts of wool and milk, it is a living, breathing reference to the phrase “what does not kill me makes me stronger”. At least, when it comes to hauling large loads, which is all some people care about.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive muffalo genes. Capable of surviving very high temperatures in opposition to the traditional use of muffalos, this hybrid performs below average for a pack animal. However, due to adaptive muscle and skeletal structure, the more it participates as part of a caravan, the heavier the load it can withstand.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. The manffalo starts as a poor caravaning animal, but learns as time progresses. Every hour spent in a caravan will increase its cargo capacity by 1%, up to a maximum of a 100% increase from base.</GR_Manffalo.description>

  <!-- Humanoid - Wolf -->

  <GR_Manwolf.label>manwolf</GR_Manwolf.label>
  <GR_Manwolf.description>Possibly either the ancestor to the warg or an attempt at creating a successor, the team in charge of making this particular hybrid clearly had read one to many mythological novels. Arguably there’s no transformation at the full moon, so you just get the permanent single form, but there’s no pleasing some people.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive canine genes. A fast and dangerous hunter with almost misplaced self-confidence. Also very intelligent and possessing faint regenerative capabilities. Extremely hardy but also extremely restrictive in their diet.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types).

  <!-- Humanoid - Cat -->

  <GR_Mancat.label>mancat</GR_Mancat.label>
  <GR_Mancat.description>A creature originally designed for other recreational purposes before that particular laboratory of degenerates got glassed from orbit, they make for an affectionate conversation partner. You know, probably, most likely, until their particular speech pattern grinds on your nerves like a cheese grater.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive feline genes. A surprisingly large yet timid predator that can output a disturbing amount of damage. Typically fun to talk to, but 10% of the time it tries to be a little too cute.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Like all cat hybrids, they have an improved melee dodge ability and a short nuzzle period. Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). In the case of the mancat, these interactions will 90% of the time increase the targets' social joy by 15%, but the rest of the time they'll just make the target very annoyed... If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts.</GR_Mancat.description>

  <!-- Humanoid - Rodent -->

  <GR_Mansquirrel.label>mansquirrel</GR_Mansquirrel.label>
  <GR_Mansquirrel.description>A bloody weird little thing that hates the cold with a passion, and will take any opportunity to clear away snow from its home. Given that they are active at nighttime, they make a great conversational companion for those otherwise asocial Night Owls you keep gathering.\n\nA humanoid hybrid with recessive rodent genes. Quite quick for their size and unusually a nocturnal animal, they make for a fast, social and quick-breeding hybrid. Will shovel snow if there are Clear Snow zones set up.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. The mansquirrel is a nocturnal animal that sleeps during the day. Will obey orders to clear snow around the colony.</GR_Mansquirrel.description>
