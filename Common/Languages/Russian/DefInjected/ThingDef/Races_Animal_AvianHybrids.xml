  <!-- Chicken - Bear -->

  <GR_Chickenbear.label>chickenbear</GR_Chickenbear.label>
  <GR_Chickenbear.description>For something so small, this animal has a hell of an appetite. Lacking in many departments, but the nutrition has to go somewhere and that’s for those looking for a non-vegan friendly option of getting high. The person who thought it would be a good idea to inhale the burning feathers of this plump creature is one stoners everywhere praise while they blaze.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive ursine genes. Has a considerably larger appetite and inherent wildness, but reproduces quickly.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Can be regularly plucked for chickenbear feathers. When these feathers are turned into powder at a Drug lab, they can be rolled into a joint to be smoked.</GR_Chickenbear.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Boomalope -->

  <GR_Chickenlope.label>chickenlope</GR_Chickenlope.label>
  <GR_Chickenlope.description>The ideal companion for those who love the smell of fried eggs and napalm in the morning. Regretfully they’re far too birdbrained to receive any direction, and most owners have been noted saying “I’ve made a huge mistake”.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive boomalope genes. Very dangerous if allowed to breed uncontrollably, so consider liberal fireproofing and selling the excess. Produces chemfuel daily as well as an egg every 2 days.</GR_Chickenlope.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Muffalo -->

  <GR_Chickenffalo.label>chickenffalo</GR_Chickenffalo.label>
  <GR_Chickenffalo.description>You wouldn’t think something so small could eat so much, but that’s the price you pay for the sake of convenience. That convenience is sporadic, low in nutrition and very thin, an effect commonly described as “nerfing”.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive muffalo genes. Loves to wander so it must be securely penned, but they make for a surprising pack beast. Capable of producing the holy trinity of milk, eggs and wool, however they can be quite lacking in substance.</GR_Chickenffalo.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Wolf -->

  <GR_Chickenwolf.label>chickenwolf</GR_Chickenwolf.label>
  <GR_Chickenwolf.description>The Tiny Terror with a disconcertingly large mouth and sharp teeth. These comic flightless web-footed little bastards may finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of just how dangerous they can make a living creature the size of a basketball.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive canine genes. Doesn’t produce much in the way of eggs but makes up for it by having a shorter gestation period and a very nasty bite. They’re also incredibly smart and agile, making them ideal for swarm tactics.</GR_Chickenwolf.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Rabbit -->

  <GR_Chickenrabbit.label>chickenrabbit</GR_Chickenrabbit.label>
  <GR_Chickenrabbit.description>One of the few unusual animal hybrids that come with their own warning labels despite being almost entirely harmless. All it took was one absent-minded vegan to cause a single couple of “Breeders” to overpopulate and devastate the ecology of an entire continent. Fairy tales surrounding the fluffy terror have done nothing to help it be taken seriously.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive rodent genes. An incredibly low metabolism coupled with an incredibly high reproduction rate, these animals are very sensitive to temperature and are unusually keen on escaping to the wilds.</GR_Chickenrabbit.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Cat -->

  <GR_Chickencat.label>chickencat</GR_Chickencat.label>
  <GR_Chickencat.description>Respectably intelligent as well as lethal, these egg-laying, plump beasties love nuzzling their owners and biting their enemies. Sometimes those are different people.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive feline genes. Quite clean with a low gestation period, they make for an average farm animal and an average combatant with good speed. They still require a pen, so they make for good home defence.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Like all cat hybrids, they have an improved melee dodge ability and a short nuzzle period.</GR_Chickencat.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Humanoid -->

  <GR_Turkeyman.label>turkeyman</GR_Turkeyman.label>
  <GR_Turkeyman.description>A cheeky little shit that likes to go around and play with switches, to satisfy their curiosity much like how an ignorant child would. Perhaps a little too smart for their own good. Their behaviour is similar to failed service animals that learn how to operate household items without restraint.\n\nAn avian hybrid with recessive humanoid genes. Surprisingly hardy, quick and very intelligent, these creatures make for a particularly filthy and hungry egg-layer. Their little wings are quite dextrous and can be used to flick switches.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. Turkeymen periodically flick switches around the colony (any building that can be toggled on / off by a colonist).</GR_Turkeyman.description>
