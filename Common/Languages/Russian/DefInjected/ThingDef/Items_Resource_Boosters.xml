  <!-- Boosters -->

  <GR_BoosterImmuno.label>immunobooster</GR_BoosterImmuno.label>
  <GR_BoosterImmuno.description>Capsules containing genetic restorative medicine that helps prevent genomes from breaking down prematurely. Effectively helps mitigate the possibility of the hybrid ending in complete failure.</GR_BoosterImmuno.description>

  <GR_BoosterHarmono.label>harmonobooster</GR_BoosterHarmono.label>
  <GR_BoosterHarmono.description>Capsules containing genetic stabilizers that help maintain the dominant-recessive genome relationship. Effectively reduces the chance of the hybrid having the opposite intended result.</GR_BoosterHarmono.description>

  <GR_BoosterTempo.label>tempobooster</GR_BoosterTempo.label>
  <GR_BoosterTempo.description>Capsules containing growth hormones that help speed up the hybrid’s growth process, halving the time it takes to complete.</GR_BoosterTempo.description>

  <GR_BoosterFertility.label>fertility unblocker</GR_BoosterFertility.label>
  <GR_BoosterFertility.description>Compressed medicine that allows hybrids to develop functional sexual organs. Effectively allows hybrids to reproduce with the exact same species.\n\nNote: Insectoid hybrids are always incapable of reproducing.</GR_BoosterFertility.description>

  <GR_StabilizedFertilityUnblocker.label>stabilized fertility unblocker</GR_StabilizedFertilityUnblocker.label>
  <GR_StabilizedFertilityUnblocker.description>Compressed medicine that allows hybrids to develop functional sexual organs. Effectively allows hybrids to reproduce with the exact same species.\n\nThis booster can't be crafted, only scavenged.\n\nNote: Insectoid hybrids are always incapable of reproducing.</GR_StabilizedFertilityUnblocker.description>

  <GR_BoosterStabilizator.label>stabilizator</GR_BoosterStabilizator.label>
  <GR_BoosterStabilizator.description>Compressed medicine that slows the growth of the specimen, increasing both stability and safety. Effectively increases growth time by 50% in exchange for a vastly increased chance of obtaining the intended result.</GR_BoosterStabilizator.description>

  <GR_BoosterController.label>controller</GR_BoosterController.label>
  <GR_BoosterController.description>Self-assembling machinery that fuses with the specimen’s nerve centers during the growth process. Effectively allows hybrids to be drafted but increases the chance of failure due to introduction of invasive foreign material.</GR_BoosterController.description>

  <GR_ImprovedController.label>improved controller</GR_ImprovedController.label>
  <GR_ImprovedController.description>Self-assembling machinery that fuses with the specimen’s nerve centers during the growth process. Effectively allows hybrids to be drafted.\n\nThis booster can't be crafted, only scavenged.</GR_ImprovedController.description>

  <GR_BoosterImmunoGreater.label>improved immunobooster</GR_BoosterImmunoGreater.label>
  <GR_BoosterImmunoGreater.description>Capsules containing genetic restorative medicine that helps prevent genomes from breaking down prematurely. Greatly helps mitigate the possibility of the hybrid ending in complete failure, at the expense of more processing time.\n\nThis booster can't be crafted, only scavenged.</GR_BoosterImmunoGreater.description>

  <GR_BoosterHarmonoGreater.label>improved harmonobooster</GR_BoosterHarmonoGreater.label>
  <GR_BoosterHarmonoGreater.description>Capsules containing genetic stabilizers that help maintain the dominant-recessive genome relationship. Greatly reduces the chance of the hybrid having the opposite intended result, at the expense of more processing time.\n\nThis booster can't be crafted, only scavenged.</GR_BoosterHarmonoGreater.description>

  <GR_MechaniteBooster.label>mechanite booster</GR_MechaniteBooster.label>
  <GR_MechaniteBooster.description>This highly sought-after booster will result in an almost perfect hybrid: fertile, draftable and genetically stable.\n\nThis booster can't be crafted, only scavenged.</GR_MechaniteBooster.description>
