  <GR_ChemfuelStomach.label>human Implant: chemfuel stomach</GR_ChemfuelStomach.label>
  <GR_ChemfuelStomach.description>A reinforced bionic stomach that uses a combination of gastric acid and chemfuel to efficiently digest food.</GR_ChemfuelStomach.description>

  <GR_ChemfuelHeart.label>human Implant: chemfuel heart</GR_ChemfuelHeart.label>
  <GR_ChemfuelHeart.description>A reinforced bionic heart that acts like a miniature 4-stroke internal combustion engine powered by chemfuel to pump blood through the body.</GR_ChemfuelHeart.description>

  <GR_WolfMuscularFibers.label>human Implant: wolf muscular fibers</GR_WolfMuscularFibers.label>
  <GR_WolfMuscularFibers.description>The subjects legs can be modified by weaving hybrid human/wolf muscle fibers within the base tissue, giving them a significant strength and speed boost.</GR_WolfMuscularFibers.description>

  <GR_DevouringJaws.label>human Implant: devouring jaws</GR_DevouringJaws.label>
  <GR_DevouringJaws.description>A set of improved teeth designed to rapidly chew and ingest any kind of food. Leaves kind of a mess, though...</GR_DevouringJaws.description>

  <GR_NeuronReinforcement.label>human Implant: neuron reinforcement</GR_NeuronReinforcement.label>
  <GR_NeuronReinforcement.description>A biochip using animal stem cells to reinforce the natural abilities of human neurons, increasing learning and research speed.</GR_NeuronReinforcement.description>

  <GR_MousePheromones.label>human Implant: mouse pheromones</GR_MousePheromones.label>
  <GR_MousePheromones.description>A bionic vomeronasal organ that allows the subject pheromonal communication with other animals, increasing the chance of taming and training them successfully.</GR_MousePheromones.description>
