  <!-- Bear - Insectoid -->

  <GR_Bearscarab.label>bearscarab</GR_Bearscarab.label>
  <GR_Bearscarab.description>An absolute unit of an insectoid hybrid, this massive chubster is incredibly smart and hard to kill. All the excess blubber has been replaced with either chitin or muscle fibre, so don’t go making comments about their bulk.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive ursine genes. Very thick armour plating and a calm temperament make this hybrid an excellent combat animal. Requires little in the way of retraining and can dish out respectable damage as well.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them.</GR_Bearscarab.description>

  <!-- Boomalope - Insectoid -->

  <GR_Boombeetle.label>boombeetle</GR_Boombeetle.label>
  <GR_Boombeetle.description>For lovers of xenomorphs everywhere, this bomb-ass bombadier is ready to launch sacs of acidic chemfuel at your enemies for fun and profit. Don’t expect a second pair of jaws though, that mouth is for spitting only.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive boomalope genes. Quite temperamental for a hybrid, but they prove to be worth it as they store caustic chemfuel in their sacs which can then be lobbed at a distance. Practically useless in melee, so keep them safe and provide fire support. Can be ordered to detonate auxiliary acid sacs as a defensive measure, but that will also self-harm.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them.</GR_Boombeetle.description>

  <!-- Chicken - Insectoid -->

  <GR_Chickenspider.label>chickenspider</GR_Chickenspider.label>
  <GR_Chickenspider.description>For the unusual connoisseur who both enjoys a healthy breakfast and the feel of silk pyjamas. A very niche market, but considering the amount of money paid for the development, people like that are too rich to be considered mad. They’re simply eccentric with refined tastes, or “tossers” as the disenfranchised call them.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive avian genes. Quite large and difficult to train for an animal that lays eggs, this particular hybrid should always be kept warm due to the various functions taking up valuable space. Capable of producing not only eggs but also valuable silk, and is protected by thin, flexible scales to resist cuts.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them.</GR_Chickenspider.description>

  <!-- Muffalo - Insectoid -->

  <GR_Muffalopede.label>muffalopede</GR_Muffalopede.label>
  <GR_Muffalopede.description>An oversized grub with udders that extrude jelly instead of milk, its hard-headedness serves it well in both getting what it wants and nutting anyone foolish enough to think they’re better than them. Allegedly there was a case where the owner was prevented from shearing the creature for so long that the overlapping plates completely prevented it from moving, who was afterwards thanked with a kick in the nether region.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive muffalo genes. Higher metabolism compared to other insectoid hybrids as well as stubborn, any predator foolish enough to think of them as an easy meal will be responded with a headbutt like a sledgehammer. Can work as a pack animal but refuses to haul comparatively heavy loads. Regularly produces precious jelly and can be sheared for chitin, which overlaps and protects the animal well from blunt attacks.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them.</GR_Muffalopede.description>

  <!-- Wolf - Insectoid -->

  <GR_Wolfscarab.label>wolfscarab</GR_Wolfscarab.label>
  <GR_Wolfscarab.description>The answer to all your worries about escaping slaves. These omnivorous vicious beasties are effectively exotic hunting dogs, and the most exotic and forbidden prey of all is humans. That is, provided they’re practically unable to defend themselves. Everyone knows you can kill as many people as you like, just don’t hurt the poor puppy trying to tear your throat out.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive canine genes. Incredibly fast and with multiple hardened jaw plates, these ferocious hunting dogs make for an excellent, intelligent combat hybrid. Unable to take much punishment but the armour plating should help against those lacking in offensive weaponry.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them.</GR_Wolfscarab.description>

  <!-- Insectoid - Cat -->

  <GR_Spidercat.label>spidercat</GR_Spidercat.label>
  <GR_Spidercat.description>People really never understand what it is to have a bad hair day, and this feisty feline is gonna help teach them. As for those who don’t want to be covered in hairballs formed from silk strands and adhesive mucus, them’s the brakes, kid. Don’t wanna get spat on, then be friends with them and get over your arachnophobia.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive feline genes. Both quick and decent offensive power, this one can handle themselves in both melee combat and a blinding ranged attack. A little difficult to train, but very clever and affectionate with flexible scales to resist cuts.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them.</GR_Spidercat.description>

  <!-- Insectoid - Humanoid -->

  <GR_Manscarab.label>manscarab</GR_Manscarab.label>
  <GR_Manscarab.description>They say you can learn a lot by taking something apart and putting it back together again. Not this creature, it doesn’t give a damn, it just wants to take things apart because the hardest part is someone else’s problem. Some people actually prefer these chitinous creatures over actual humans as they’re not going to use up good material in a botched attempt.\n\nAn insectoid hybrid with recessive humanoid genes. Easy to train, quite resilient but not a great combatant. This particular hybrid fills the niche of fulfilling deconstruction orders around the colony, freeing up otherwise valuable manpower.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Humanoid hybrids will periodically engage other colonists in conversation, talking about a variety of topics. This increases the social recreation needs of those they interact with by 10% (subject to diminishing returns like all joy types). If using Ideology, humanoid hybrids are subject to precepts. All insectoid hybrids have good armor and no toxic sensitivity, but they are always sterile and can't reproduce, even if a fertility booster is used to create them. Menscarab will take building deconstruction orders around the colony.</GR_Manscarab.description>
