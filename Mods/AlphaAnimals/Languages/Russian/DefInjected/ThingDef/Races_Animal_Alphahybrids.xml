  <GR_Boomalisk.label>boomalisk</GR_Boomalisk.label>

  <!-- Chicken -->

  <GR_Needlechicken.label>needlechicken</GR_Needlechicken.label>

  <!-- Reptile -->

  <GR_MeadowLizard.label>meadow lizard</GR_MeadowLizard.label>
  <GR_MeadowLizard.description>The meadow lizard is a beast bred for speed. Even though they are naturally slower than meadow aves, they can be trained to be incredibly fast mounts.\n\nUseful abilities: if properly trained they can be ridden into battle at incredible speeds (this interaction needs the Giddy-Up, combat mounts mod, and it will make the Meadow Lizards move 100% faster when used as mounts). They are also venomous.</GR_MeadowLizard.description>
