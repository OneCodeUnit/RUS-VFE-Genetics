  <!-- Bear -->

  <GR_EldritchBear.label>bear young</GR_EldritchBear.label>
  <GR_EldritchBear.description>This otherworldly bear has repulsive, purple coloured tentacles protruding from its maw. Its pelt has a strange wooden-like appearance. Its ravenous appetite can only be sated by consuming large amounts of meat, which the creature dissolves with the green acidic goo dropping from its many gaping maws.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; All bear hybrids have stun attacks. Since the creature constantly regenerates, its tentacles can be trimmed every few days, and used as a substitute for wood.</GR_EldritchBear.description>
